## Dataset
The dataset used for this assignment can be downloaded from this [link](https://fbref.com/en/comps/9/Premier-League-Stats). For each club in the EPL, we downloaded data for Standard Statistics, Passing, Defensive Actions and Possession as CSV files. These files were then merged and wrangled for each team such that we had one merged data set for each team. The datasets directory has a total of 20 teams.

## Tools Used
The tools we used in this assignment have been summarized through below:

• Python was used as the primary programming language. 

• The pandas library was used for data preprocessing and wrangling.

• The SciPy library was used to carry out computations like finding rank of a value.

• Matplotlib and Plotly were used to create visualizations.

• Dash was used for creating the dashboard along with the Python programming language.
