Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be downloaded from this [link](https://fbref.com/en/comps/9/Premier-League-Stats). For each club in the English Premier League, we downloaded data for Standard Statistics, Passing, Defensive Actions and Possession as CSV files. These files were then merged and wrangled for each team such that we had one merged data set for each team. The datasets directory has a total of 20 teams.
